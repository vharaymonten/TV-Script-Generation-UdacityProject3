# TV-Script-Generation

# Overview 
This Project is about training a model that can generate TV script at any wanted length of words. By implementing LSTMs and Word Embeddings the model is able to learn from orignal data (original tv script) close to original data. Hyperparameters used to train the model were able to reach reasonable result but not the best values. Feel free to learn from it and try experimenting  diffrent hyperparameters values to improve model's performance.
